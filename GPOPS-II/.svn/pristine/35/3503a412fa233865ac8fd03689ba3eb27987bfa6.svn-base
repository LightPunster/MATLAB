         tool TAPENADE. Given a source computer program that computes a differentiable mathematical function
         F, TAPENADE builds a new source program that computes some of the derivatives of F, specifically
         directional derivatives (``tangent mode'') and gradients (``reverse mode'').
         This report summarizes the mathematical justifications of Automatic Differentiation, then describes
         in full detail the differentiation model that TAPENADE implements. Our goal is to give the users of
         TAPENADE a precise understanding of the actions and choices made while differentiating programs, so
         as to improve their confidence in the produced source programs. This report documents all the
         available options and parameterizations that the users can give to TAPENADE, and conversely all the
         diagnosis and requirements that TAPENADE may issue towards the users. After a brief description of
         TAPENADE's architecture and performances, this report describes more fully the validation and

         Fortran program. The derivative evaluation is performed by a Fortran code resulting from the
         analysis and transformation of the original program that defines the function of interest. OpenADF
         has been designed with a particular emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and the use of open source
         components. While the code transformation follows the basic principles of automatic differentiation,
         the tool implements new algorithmic approaches at various levels, for example, for basic block
         preaccumulation and call graph reversal. Unlike most other automatic differentiation tools, OpenAD/F
         uses components provided by the OpenAD framework, which supports a comparatively easy extension of
         the code transformations in a language-independent fashion. It uses code analysis results
         implemented in the OpenAnalysis component. The interface to the language-independent transformation
         engine is an XML-based format, specified through an XML schema. The implemented transformation
         algorithms allow efficient derivative computations using locally optimized cross-country sequences
         of vertex, edge, and face elimination steps. Specifically, for the generation of adjoint codes,
         OpenAD/F supports various code reversal schemes with hierarchical checkpointing at the subroutine
         level. As an example from geophysical fluid dynamics a nonlinear time-dependent scalable, yet
         simple, barotropic ocean model is considered. OpenAD/F's reverse mode is applied to compute
         sensitivities of some of the model's transport properties with respect to gridded fields such
         as bottom topography as independent (control) variables."

                  The computations of the high-order partial derivatives in
                  a given problem are often cumbersome or not accurate. To
                  combat such shortcomings, a new method for calculating
                  exact high-order sensitivities using multicomplex numbers
                  is presented. Inspired by the recent complex step method
                  that is only valid for first order sensitivities, the new
                  multicomplex approach is valid to arbitrary order. The
                  mathematical theory behind this approach is revealed, and
                  an efficient procedure for the automatic implementation
                  of the method is described. Several applications are
                  presented to validate and demonstrate the accuracy and
                  efficiency of the algorithm. The results are compared
                  to conventional approaches such as finite differencing,
                  the complex step method, and two separate automatic
                  differentiation tools. The multicomplex method performs
                  favorably in the preliminary comparisons and is therefore
                  expected to be useful for a variety of algorithms that
		  exploit higher order derivatives.",

                 An algorithm is described to solve multiple-phase optimal
                 control problems using a recently developed numerical
                 method called the Gauss pseudospectral method. The
                 algorithm is well-suited for use in modern vectorized
                 programming languages such as FORTRAN 95 and MATLAB. The
                 algorithm discretizes the cost functional and the
                 differential-algebraic equations in each phase of the
                 optimal control problem. The phases are then connected
                 using linkage conditions on the state and time. A
                 large-scale nonlinear programming problem (NLP) arises
                 from the discretization and the significant features of
                 the NLP are described in detail. A particular reusable
                 MATLAB implementation of the algorithm, called GPOPS,
                 is applied to three classical optimal control problems
                 to demonstrate its utility. The algorithm described
                 in this paper will provide researchers and engineers a
                 useful software tool and a reference when it is desired
                 to implement the Gauss pseudospectral method in other
                 programming languages.",

Abstract = {{An introduction to both automatic differentiation and object-oriented
   programming can enrich a numerical analysis course that typically
   incorporates numerical differentiation and basic MATLAB computation.
   Automatic differentiation consists of exact algorithms on floating-point
   arguments. This implementation overloads standard elementary operators
   and functions in MATLAB with a derivative rule in addition to the
   function value; for example, sin u will also compute (cos u) {*} u', w
   here u and u' are numerical values. These methods are mostly one-line
   programs that operate on a class of value-and-derivative objects,
   providing a simple example of object-oriented programming in MATLAB
   using the new(as of release 2008a) class definition structure. The
   resulting powerful tool computes derivative values and multivariable
   gradients, and is applied to Newton's method for root-finding in both
   single and multivariable settings. To compute higher-order derivatives
   of a single-variable function, another class of series objects keeps
   Taylor polynomial coefficients up to some order. Overloading
   multiplication on series objects is a combination (discrete convolution)
   of coefficients. This idea leads to algorithms for other operations and
   functions on series objects. A survey of more advanced topics in
   automatic differentiation includes an introduction to the reverse mode
   (our implementation is forward mode) and considerations in
   arbitrary-order multivariable series computation.}},
